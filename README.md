# Tic Tac Toe
### Description
Produce a working game of tic tac toe given a three-by-three grid template

### Languages Used
* JavaScript

The grid was already made with HTML with CSS styling but these were not to be altered in any way.

3. In your terminal, in your desired location, carry out the command 'git clone -SSH key-'

### Challenges
It was difficult at first to alternate between clicks since this is a two player game; alternating between X and O. However, this was overcome using booleans - using 'if' statements and changing the value of the boolean allowed me to change the outcome of the click depending on the value. Also, I did not manage to generate a win condition, so the game continues without alerting who won the game. I tried using arrays, specifically the 'indexOf()' function but I was missing something which prevented it from working.

### Learning Points
I'm getting more comfortable with object oriented programming and manipulating the DOM, for example creating and calling elements, assigning classes etc. using just JavaScript.
